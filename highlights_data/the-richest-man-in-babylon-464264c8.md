### The Man Who Desired Gold

Naught

Might we not find out how others acquire gold and do as they do?

a man’s wealth is not in the purse he carries.

Methinks

remonstrated

the one kind being the things we learned and knew, and the other being the training that taught us how to find out what we did not know?

sunup

But too often does youth think that age knows only the wisdom of days that are gone, and therefore profits not. But remember this, the sun that shines today is the sun that shone when thy father was born, and will still be shining when thy last grandchild shall pass into the darkness.

I found the road to wealth when I decided that a part of all I earned was mine to keep. And so will you

That was sufficient to change the heart of a sheep herder into the heart of a money lender,’ he replied.

Wealth, like a tree, grows from a tiny seed. The first copper you save is the seed from which your tree of wealth shall grow. The sooner you plant that seed the sooner shall the tree grow. And the more faithfully you nourish and water that tree with consistent savings, the sooner may you bask in contentment beneath its shade.

Advice is one thing that is freely given away, but watch that you take only what is worth having

Fortunate only in that I had the desire to prosper before I first met him

Opportunity is a haughty goddess who wastes no time with those who are unprepared.

Life is good and life is rich with things worthwhile and things to enjoy

A part of all you earn is yours to keep.

### Seven Cures for a Lean Purse

Surely it is a law of the Gods that unto him who keepeth and spendeth not a certain part of all his earnings, shall gold come more easily. Likewise, him whose purse is empty does gold avoid.

The coins thou takest from thy purse bring the first. The coins thou leavest within it will bring the latter.

This, my students, was the first cure I did discover for my lean purse: ‘For each ten coins I put in, to spend but nine.

That what each of us calls our ‘necessary expenses’ will always grow to equal our incomes unless we protest to the contrary.

Confuse not the necessary expenses with thy desires. Each of you, together with your good families, have more desires than your earnings can gratify

I say to you that just as weeds grow in a field wherever the farmer leaves space for their roots, even so freely do desires grow in men whenever there is a possibility of their being gratified.

I tell you, my students, a man’s wealth is not in the coins he carries in his purse; it is the income he buildeth, the golden stream that continually floweth into his purse and keepeth it always bulging

to put each coin to laboring that it may reproduce its kind even as the flocks of the field and help bring to thee income, a stream of wealth that shall flow constantly into thy purse.”


Own thy own home

This lesson shall instruct thee in providing a full purse when time has made thee less able to learn.

The man who, because of his understanding of the laws of wealth, acquireth a growing surplus, should give thought to those future days. He should plan certain investments or provision that may endure safely for many years, yet will be available when the time arrives which he has so wisely anticipated.

Provide in advance for the needs of thy growing age and the protection of thy family.

Preceding accomplishment must be desire. Thy desires must be strong and definite. General desires are but weak longings. For a man to wish to be rich is of little purpose. For a man to desire five pieces of gold is a tangible desire which he can press to fulfillment

Desires must be simple and definite. They defeat their own purpose should they be too many, too confusing, or beyond a man’s training to accomplish.

He must pay his debts with all the promptness within his power, not purchasing that for which he is unable to pay.
“He must take care of his family that they may think and speak well of him.
“He must make a will of record that, in case the Gods call him, proper and honorable division of his property be accomplished.
“He must have compassion upon those who are injured and smitten by misfortune and aid them within reasonable limits. He must do deeds of thoughtfulness to those dear to him.

Thus the seventh and last remedy for a lean purse is to cultivate thy own powers, to study and become wiser, to become more skillful, to so act as to respect thyself. Thereby shalt thou acquire confidence in thy self to achieve thy carefully considered desires.

### The Five Laws of Gold

A bag heavy with gold or a clay tablet carved with words of wisdom; if thou hadst thy choice, which wouldst thou choose?

Gold cometh gladly and in increasing quantity to any man who will put by not less than one-tenth of his earngs to create an estate for his future and that of his family.
2. Gold laboreth diligently and contentedly for the wise owner who finds for it profitable employment, multiplying even as the flocks of the field.
3. Gold clingeth to the protection of the cautious owner who invests it under the advice of men wise in its handling.
4. Gold slippeth away from the man who invests it in businesses or

purposes with which he is not familiar or which are not approved by those skilled in its keep.
5. Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment.

Gold flees the man who would force it to impossible earnings or who followeth the alluring advice of tricksters and schemers or who trusts it to his own inexperience and romantic desires in investment.

Our wise acts accompany us through life to please us and to help us. Just as surely, our unwise acts follow us to plague and torment us.

### The Gold Lender of Babylon

If you desire to help thy friend, do so in a way that will not bring thy friend’s burdens upon thyself.

The chest tells you, Rodan, that humans in the throes of great emotions are not safe risks for the gold lender.

if they borrow because of their indiscretions, I warn thee to be cautious if thou wouldst ever have thy gold back in hand again.

bantered

Youth, never having had experience, cannot realize that hopeless debt is like a deep pit into which one may descend quickly and where one may struggle vainly for many days. It is a pit of sorrow and regrets where the brightness of the sun is overcast and night is made unhappy by restless sleeping

sterling

The wise lender wishes not the risk of the undertaking but the guarantee of safe repayment.

Then be not swayed by foolish sentiments of obligation to trust thy treasure to any person. If thou wouldst help thy family or thy friends, find other ways than risking the loss of thy treasure. Forget not that gold slippeth away in unexpected ways from those unskilled in guarding it. As well waste thy treasure in extravagance as let others lose it for thee.

Better a little caution than a great regret.

### The Walls of Babylon

clamor

In this day, behind the impregnable walls of insurance, savings accounts and dependable investments, we can guard ourselves against the unexpected tragedies that may enter any door and seat themselves before any fireside

We cannot afford to be without adequate protection.

### The Camel Trader of Babylon

stupor

parched

the soul of a free man looks at life as a series of problems to be solved and solves them, while the soul of a slave whines, ‘What can I do who am but a slave?

Where the determination is, the way can be found
