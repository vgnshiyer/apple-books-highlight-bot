To distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life on a regular basis and recognize that inactivity is not the goal. Doing that which excites you is.

To be neither the boss nor the employee, but the owner. To own the trains and have someone else ensure they run on time.

The employee who rearranges his schedule and negotiates a remote work agreement to achieve 90% of the results in one-tenth of the time, which frees him to practice cross-country skiing and take road trips with his family two weeks per month.
 The business owner who eliminates the least profitable customers and projects, outsources all operations entirely, and travels the world collecting rare documents, all while working remotely on a website to showcase her own illustration work.
 The student who elects to risk it all—which is nothing—to establish an online video rental service that delivers $5,000 per month in income from a small niche of Blu-ray aficionados, a two-hour-per-week side project that allows him to work full-time as an animal rights lobbyist

If the recipe sucks, it doesn’t matter how good a cook you are.

It is predicated on the assumption that you dislike what you are doing during the most physically capable years of your life

Most people will never be able to retire and maintain even a hotdogs-for-dinner standard of living

If the math does work, it means that you are one ambitious, hardworking machine. If that’s the case, guess what? One week into retirement, you’ll be so damn bored that you’ll want to stick bicycle spokes in your eyes. You’ll probably opt to look for a new job or start another company. Kinda defeats the purpose of waiting, doesn’t it?

By working only when you are most effective, life is both more productive and more enjoyable. It’s the perfect example of having your cake and eating it, too.

Doing less meaningless work, so that you can focus on things of greater personal importance, is NOT laziness.

The NR, despite fewer hours in the office, produce more meaningful results than the next dozen non-NR combined.

Focus on being productive instead of busy.

try it and then justify it.

Get good at being a troublemaker and saying sorry when you really screw up.

It is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths instead of attempting to fix all the chinks in your armor.

Focus on better use of your best weapons instead of constant repair.

positive use of free time, defined simply as doing what you want as opposed to what you feel obligated to do.

Relative income uses two variables: the dollar and time, usually hours

The New Rich are equally aggressive in removing distress and finding eustress.

For nearly five years, he had faced his alarm clock with the same dread: I have to do this for another 40–45 years?

Most people will choose unhappiness over uncertainty.

expletive  _NOTE: Swear word_

None of these things would be fatal—not even close  _NOTE: Imagine the worst that could happen if u face fear.. _

In other words, I was risking an unlikely and temporary 3 or 4 for a probable and permanent 9 or 10, and I could easily recover my baseline workaholic prison with a bit of extra work if I wanted to

Don’t save it all for the end. There is every reason not to.

I am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened.

it is fear of unknown outcomes that prevents us from doing what we need to do. Define the worst case, accept it, and do it.

 What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do

It is equally important to measure the atrocious cost of inaction. If you don’t pursue those things that excite you, where will you be in one year, five years, and ten years?

inaction is the greatest risk of all

Living like a millionaire requires doing interesting things and not just owning enviable things

Life is too short to be small.

Tomorrow becomes never. No matter how small the task, take the first step now!

Believe it or not, it is not only possible to accomplish more by doing less, it is mandatory.
Enter the world of elimination.

Work 40 hours a week and produce 8 times the results.” This is an endless game and one you want to avoid. Hence the need for Liberation first.

Doing something unimportant well does not make it important.
Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important.

What you do is infinitely more important than how you do it. Efficiency is still important, but it is useless unless applied to the right things.

80% of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs

maximum income from minimal necessary effort (including minimum number of customers) is the primary goal

Being busy is a form of laziness—lazy thinking and indiscriminate action.

Being selective—doing less—is the path of the productive. Focus on the important few and ignore the rest

you will need to try a lot to identify what pulls the most weight. Throw it all up on the wall and see what sticks

It’s easy to get caught in a flood of minutiae, and the key to not feeling rushed is remembering that lack of time is actually lack of priorities

The world has agreed to shuffle papers between 9:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M., and since you’re trapped in the office for that period of servitude, you are compelled to create activities to fill that time

Parkinson’s Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline. If I give you 24 hours to complete a project, the time pressure forces you to focus on execution, and you have no choice but to do only the bare essentials

The best solution is to use both together: Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income and schedule them with very short and clear deadlines.

What 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness?
What 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcome and happiness?

masochistic  _NOTE: Self harming_

But you are the average of the five people you associate with most, so do not underestimate the effects of your pessimistic, unambitious, or disorganized friends

Don’t ever arrive at the office or in front of your computer without a clear list of priorities

Shorten schedules and deadlines to necessitate focused action instead of deliberation and procrastination.

use impossibly short deadlines to force immediate action while ignoring minutiae.

Hence, a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.

is imperative that you learn to ignore or redirect all information and interruptions that are irrelevant, unimportant, or unactionable. Most are all three.
The first step is to develop and maintain a low-information diet

I read the front-page headlines through the newspaper machines as I walk to lunch each day and nothing more. In five years, I haven’t had a single problem due to this selective ignorance. It gives you something new to ask the rest of the population in lieu of small talk: “Tell me, what’s new in the world?” And, if it’s that important, you’ll hear people talking about it. Using my crib notes approach to world affairs, I also retain more than someone who loses the forest for the trees in a sea of extraneous details

how I did it” and autobiographical

I only read the sections of the book that were relevant to immediate next steps, which took less than two hours

How to Read 200% Faster in 10 Minutes

The world doesn’t even hiccup, much less end, when you cut the information umbilical cord

More is not better, and stopping something is often 10 times better than finishing it.

Interrupting Interruption and theArt of Refusal

Common time wasters include meetings, discussions, phone calls, web surfing, and e-mail that are unimportant

It is a matter of limiting access and funneling all communication toward immediate action.

First, limit e-mail consumption and production. This is the greatest single interruption in the modern world.

Turn off the audible alert if you have one on Outlook or a similar program and turn off automatic send/receive, which delivers e-mail to your inbox as soon as someone sends them.
Check e-mail twice per day, once at 12:00 noon or just prior to lunch, and again at 4:00 P.M. 12:00 P.M. and 4:00 P.M. are times that ensure you will have the most responses from previously sent e-mail. Never check e-mail first thing in the morning.12Instead, complete your most important task before 11:00 A.M. to avoid using lunch or reading e-mail as a postponement excuse.

Beg for forgiveness; don’t ask for permission.

Here is a simple e-mail template that can be used

Use the cell number in the e-mail autoresponse and answer it at all times unless it is an unknown caller or it is a call you don’t want to answer. If in doubt, allow the call to go to voicemail and listen to the voicemail immediately afterward to gauge importance. If it can wait, let it wait. The offending parties have to learn to wait.

The office phone should be put on silent mode and allowed to go to voicemail at all times

Hi, John. I’m right in the middle of something. How can I help you out?

No, I have a minute. What can I do for you?

Don’t encourage people to chitchat and don’t let them chitchat. Get them to the point immediately. If they meander or try to postpone for a later undefined call, reel them in and get them to come to the point. If they go into a long description of a problem, cut in with, “[Name], sorry to interrupt, but I have a call in five minutes. What can I do to help out?” You might instead say, “[Name], sorry to interrupt, but I have a call in five minutes. Can you send me an e-mail?”

The third step is to master the art of refusal and avoiding meetings.

avoid all meetings, whether in person or remote, that do not have clear objectives

Don’t suffer fools or you’ll become one.
It is your job to train those around you to be effective and efficient. No one else will do it for you.

Decide that, given the non-urgent nature of most issues, you will steer people toward the following means of communication, in order of preference: e-mail, phone, and in-person meetings

Can you meet at 4:00 P.M.? If so If not, please advise three other times that work for you.”

That sounds doable. So I can best prepare, can you please send me an e-mail with an agenda? That is, the topics and questions we’ll need to address? That would be great. Thanks in advance.

Don’t give them a chance to bail out. The “thanks in advance” before a retort increases your chances of getting the e-mail

Speaking of 30 minutes, if you absolutely cannot stop a meeting or call from happening, define the end time. Do not leave these discussions open-ended, and keep them short

Cite other commitments at odd times to make them more believable (e.g., 3:20 vs. 3:30) and force people to focus instead of socializing, commiserating, and digressing. If you must join a meeting that is scheduled to last a long time or that is open-ended, inform the organizer that you would like permission to cover your portion first, as you have a commitment in 15 minutes.

The cubicle is your temple—don’t permit casual visitors

Hi, invader. I’m right in the middle of something. How can I be of help?” If it’s not clear within 30 seconds, ask the person to send you an e-mail about the chosen issue; do not offer to send them an e-mail first: “I’ll be happy to help, but I have to finish this first. Can you send me a quick e-mail to remind me?”

There is an inescapable setup time for all tasks, large or minuscule in scale. It is often the same for one as it is for a hundred

There is a psychological switching of gears that can require up to 45 minutes to resume a major task that has been interrupted

Do not work harder when the solution is working smarter

It’s amazing how someone’s IQ seems to double as soon as you give them responsibility and indicate that you trust them

People are smarter than you think. Give them a chance to prove themselves

Before this conversation, develop a number of “rules” like the previous example that would allow you to work more autonomously with less approval-seeking.

Empower others to act without interrupting you.

Limit access to your time, force people to define their requests before spending time with them, and batch routine menial tasks to prevent postponement of more important projects. Do not let people interrupt you. Find your focus and you’ll find your lifestyle
